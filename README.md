# Migration Snippets

Example usages for the ProcessWire [Migrations](https://github.com/LostKobrakai/Migrations) module. The examples are mostly meant to showcase how those examples work as well as being a good glosary to go to. It's neither meant to be complete nor assured working code. Please use those with precaution and test those snippets before running them in any production environment. Also do not copy those files directy, because their naming schema does not fit the modules requirements. Rather copy their contents into migrations created by the module.
